# LSM-Adaptive-Filter (IEEE754)
This project implements a Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filter in Verilog, designed with full parameterization for maximum flexibility.
The user can configure:

Number of input samples

Tap length (filter order)

Desired signal

Step size (Î¼)

The design supports easy experimentation with adaptive filtering concepts and can be used for noise cancellation, channel equalization, and real-time signal processing .

Features :

Parameterized inputs for reusability

Supports dynamic selection of tap length and step size

IEEE 754 based Modules foe internal operations: MUL,ADD,SUB etc

Testbench included for verification
